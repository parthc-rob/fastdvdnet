# FastDVDnet

A state-of-the-art, simple and fast network for Deep Video Denoising which uses no motion compensation.

NEW: Paper to be presented at CVPR2020

Previous deep video denoising algorithm: [DVDnet](https://github.com/m-tassano/dvdnet)

## Overview

This source code provides a PyTorch implementation of the FastDVDnet video denoising algorithm, as in 
Tassano, Matias and Delon, Julie and Veit, Thomas. ["FastDVDnet: Towards Real-Time Deep Video Denoising Without Flow Estimation", arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.01361 (2019).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01361)

### Edits - Python 2.7 - ROS Melodic

This branch adapts the repo to work with Python 2.7 with the goal of using this algorithm as a ROS node (there are compatibility issues between Python3 and ROS Melodic and earlier distros).

## Video Examples

You can download several denoised sequences with our algorithm and other methods [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m9mpz1m1b55x420/AAAt1wes43brv37BmBxw07jna?dl=0 "FastDVDnet denoised sequences") (more videos coming soon)

## Running Times

FastDVDnet is orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art methods

## Code User Guide

### Dependencies

The code runs on Python +3.6. You can create a conda environment with all the dependecies by running (Thanks to Antoine Monod for the .yml file)
```
conda env create -f requirements.yml -n <env_name>
```

Note: this project needs the [NVIDIA DALI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI) package for training. The tested version of DALI is 0.10.0. If you prefer to install it yourself (supposing you have CUDA 10.0), you need to run
```
pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/cuda/10.0 nvidia-dali==0.10.0 
```

### Testing

If you want to denoise an image sequence using the pretrained model you can execute

```
test_fastdvdnet.py \
	--test_path <path_to_input_sequence> \
	--noise_sigma 30 \
	--save_path results
```

**NOTES**
* The image sequence should be stored under <path_to_input_sequence>
* The model has been trained for values of noise in [5, 55]
* run with *--no_gpu* to run on CPU instead of GPU
* run with *--save_noisy* to save noisy frames
* set *max_num_fr_per_seq* to set the max number of frames to load per sequence
* to denoise _clipped AWGN_ run with *--model_file model_clipped_noise.pth*
* run with *--help* to see details on all input parameters

### Training

If you want to train your own models you can execute

```
train_fastdvdnet.py \
	--trainset_dir <path_to_input_mp4s> \
	--valset_dir <path_to_val_sequences> \
	--log_dir logs
```

**NOTES**
* As the dataloader in based on the DALI library, the training sequences must be provided as mp4 files, all under <path_to_input_mp4s>
* The validation sequences must be stored as image sequences in individual folders under <path_to_val_sequences>
* run with *--help* to see details on all input parameters
